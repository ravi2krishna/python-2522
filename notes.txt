                implementations
    
13th Oct 2025
=============

    -> Type Conversion / Implicit Conversion 

        -> Type Conversion means python automatically converts one data type to another 

        -> Python automatically performs Type Conversion as it's SAFE 

    -> Type Casting / Explicit Conversion 

        -> Type Casting means, you need to explicitly convert one data type to another 

        -> Python doesn't automatically performs Type Casting as it's UNSAFE  (data loss)

        -> We use some predefined functions to achieve Type Casting

    -> Control Structures / Statements 

        -> Till now the program executes sequentially line by line, now 
        we want to control the flow of program

        -> Python has given following  Control Structures

            -> Conditional Statements (Decision Making Statements)

            -> Looping Statements (Iteration Statements)

            -> Branching Statements (Jump Statements)
        
        -> Indentation

            -> Indentation refers to space (how to use spaces in programs)

            -> When Working with Blocks (control Structures, functions, classes etc)

            -> Either use a single or tab (don't use both, fix to one )

                -> How many spaces ? 

                    -> At least 1 (python recommended is 4 spaces i.e tab)
            
            -> All lines in the same block should have same indentation level 

    -> Conditional Statements 

        -> Conditional Statements / Decision Making Statements are used to run 
            a block of code based on condition result 

            -> if Statement : runs a block of code, only if the condition is True

                -> syntax 
                    if condition:
                        Statements

            -> if else Statement : runs a block of code, if the condition is True
                                   runs another block of code, if the condition is False
                
                -> syntax 
                    if condition:
                        Statements
                    else:
                        Statements

            -> NOTE: input() function reads the input from user / keyboard 

            -> NOTE : ternary operator - same as if-else with short hand code (concise code)

                        variable = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false 

            -> elif ladder : runs blocks of code,  with multiple Conditional checks 

14th Oct 2025
=============

    -> Other Programming Languages Like Java / C++ (switch case)

    -> match-case was introduced in python 3.X Onwards

    -> it's an alternative to elif approach 

    -> Nested Conditionals 

        -> Conditionals inside Conditionals


    -> Looping Statements (Iteration Statements)

        -> Loops - Execute a block of code repeatedly, based on
                   condition 
        
        -> When To Use : When You want to repeat a task multiple times 

        -> Types Of Loops 

            -> while loop 

                -> Runs/Repeats a block of code, as long as the condition is true 

                -> You can use while loop, when you don't know number of iterations in advance 

            -> for loop 

                -> Used to iterate over a sequence data type (strings, lists etc)

                -> You can use for loop, when you know number of iterations in advance 


15th Oct 2025
=============

    -> for loop demo works with sequences i.e should have __iter__ (dir())

    -> range() 

        -> this function generates a sequence of numbers, mostly used With
            loops and conditions

        -> syntax 

            range(start,stop,step) 
                -> start default is 0 (included)
                -> stop at this value (excluded)
                -> step increment (default is 1)

            range(5) # [0,1,2,3,4]
            range(1,6) # [1,2,3,4,5]
            range(2,10,1) # [2,3,4,5...9]
            range(2,10,2) # [2,4,6...8]


    -> Nested Loops 

        -> Loops inside loops 

        syntax for nested for loop 

            for var_outer in range(choice):
                for var_inner in range(choice):
                    // logic

16th Oct 2025
=============    

    -> Branching Statements (Jump Statements)

        -> break : helps you exit loops

        -> continue : helps you skip the current iteration in loop 

        -> pass : acts as a placeholder, does nothing

        -> String is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes or double quotes (recommended)

            -> We can enclose Strings in triple quotes (recommended for multi line strings)

            -> single line strings - single quotes or double quotes

            -> multi line strings - triple single quotes or triple double quotes


        -> Rules when defining strings 

            -> Strings must be enclosed single quotes or double quotes or single quotes or triple double quotes

            -> When you need single quote in a string, enclose them in double quotes (" ")

            -> When you need double quote in a string, enclose them in single quotes (' ')

            -> When you need both single & double quotes in a string, enclose them in triple quotes (''' ''')


    -> Access Strings 

        -> Access using variable 

        -> Indexing 
        
            -> Python allows you to access individual characters inside a string 
                using index number 
            
            -> index starts from zero and increments 

            -> text = "python"


                0   1   2   3   4   5 (Positive Indexing) (Left To Right) (---->)
                p   y   t   h   o   n
                -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1 (Negative Indexing) (Right To Left) (<----)

            -> Syntax 

                string[index]

            -> Accessing invalid index will raise errors (IndexError)

    -> Slicing 

        -> Extracting a portion of string from another string(substring), we use index Numbers

            range(start, stop, step) 
            slice[start: stop: step]

                -> start default is 0 (included)
                -> stop at this value (excluded)
                -> step increment (default is 1)

        -> Immutable means cannot be changed
    
    -> String is a predefined class in python and it has various methods 

        -> String operations can be performed using string methods 

22nd Oct 2025
=============

    -> String Methods 

        -> String methods in Python are built-in functions that operate on 
        string objects, allowing for various manipulations, transformations, and checks. 
        It is important to note that strings in Python are immutable, 
        meaning these methods do not modify the original string but 
        instead return a new string with the applied changes.

    -> Functional Style Programming

    -> Functions 

        -> In Python, a function is a named, reusable block of code 
        designed to perform a specific task. 
        
        -> Why Functions  
            
            -> For writing modular, organized and efficient code.

            -> Functions can break down complex problems into smaller and simpler 
                manageable sub tasks for promoting code modularity 

            -> You can call a function multiple times, once defined, so that we can 
                achieve code Reusability 

        -> Functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, 
            parentheses (which may contain parameters), and a colon. 
            The code within the function is indented.


        -> syntax 

            def function_name():
                Statements 
            
            def function_name(parameters):
                Statements 


4th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Python functions can be defined to accept "parameters", 
        which act as placeholders for values that will be passed into the function 
        when it is called. These values are known as "arguments".

    -> We use parameters to make functions dynamic in nature 

    -> Based on arguments passed to functions, we got five types 

        -> Positional Arguments

        -> Keywords Arguments
        
        -> Default Arguments

        -> Arbitrary Positional Arguments

        -> Arbitrary Keywords Arguments
    
    -> Positional Arguments

        -> In Python, positional arguments are values passed to a function during 
        its call, where the assignment of these values to the function's parameters 
        is determined solely by their order (position) in the argument list. 
        The first argument in the function call is assigned to the first parameter 
        in the function definition, the second to the second, and so on. 

        -> Order Matters: If the order is incorrect, the function will receive the wrong values 
            for its intended parameters, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.


    -> Keywords Arguments

        -> In Python, keyword arguments are a way to pass values to a function by explicitly 
        naming the parameters they correspond to, rather than relying on their position in the argument list. 
        This offers several advantages, primarily in terms of code readability and flexibility.
 

    -> Default Arguments

        -> In Python, default arguments allow you to define a function parameter with a pre-assigned value. 
        If a caller does not provide an argument for that parameter during a function call, 
        the default value is automatically used. If an argument is provided, it overrides the default.

        -> Placement Requirement: Default arguments must always be placed after any non-default (positional) 
            arguments in the function definition. 
            Attempting to place a non-default argument after a default argument will result in a SyntaxError.


    -> Arbitrary Positional Arguments

        -> In Python, arbitrary positional arguments allow a function to accept 
            a variable number of non-keyword arguments. 
            This is achieved by placing an asterisk (*) before a parameter name in the function definition. 
            
        -> This parameter will then collect all the extra positional arguments passed to the function 
            into a single tuple. 


    -> Arbitrary Keywords Arguments

        -> In Python, arbitrary keyword arguments, often represented as **kwargs, allow a function 
            to accept an unspecified number of keyword arguments. 
            These arguments are collected into a dictionary within the function, 
            where the argument names become the keys and 
            their corresponding values become the dictionary values.
        
        -> Include a parameter prefixed with two asterisks (**) in the function definition


5th Nov 2025
=============

    -> In Python, the "return" keyword is used within a function to send a value 
        back to the part of the code that called the function.

    -> when you don't use a return, by default a function returns None 

    -> If you use return, make sure it's the last part of Statement to be executed

    -> If you have multiple return Statements, first will be considered 

    -> If multiple returns are present, and used with conditionals, you can control flow 

    -> Function Composition 

        -> Function Calling Another Function 

    -> Scopes in Functions 

        -> Scope : Inside the code block, where you can access variable depends on Scope

        -> Local Scope

        -> Global Scope 

    -> Local Scope

        -> A local variable declared inside the function 
        -> it's lifetime exists only within the function
        -> we cannot use them outside the function 
        -> NOTE : Parameters we are passing to the functions, are also local variables 

    -> Global Scope

        -> A Global variable declared outside the function 
        -> it's lifetime exists within the function as well as outside function
        -> As global variables can be accessed inside the functions, there can be
            name conflicts, in this scenario the preference is given to local variables 

                -> NOTE : To Access Global Variable in above scenario, use globals()

        -> If you want global variables to be changed inside the function, we cannot 
            do that directly 

                -> NOTE : To change Global Variable inside function, use global keyword
            

6th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Types Of Functions 

        -> Built in functions 

            -> Pre defined functions, already part of standard python library 

            -> No need to explicitly create again using def keyword

            -> common utilities are generally predefined functions 

            -> examples 

                -> type, len, max, min, dir, id, input etc 

        -> Module Based Functions 

            -> Pre defined functions, given by vendors 

            -> Download modules or use system builtin modules 

            -> utilities designed for specific functionalities 

        -> User Defined Functions 

            -> User Defined functions are created by Developers, using def keyword

            -> Custom functionalities based on user given Requirements

            -> add(), emp_info() etc 

        
        -> Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions) 

            -> A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function 
            defined with the "lambda" keyword. 
            
            -> Unlike standard functions defined with def, lambda functions are 
            restricted to a "single expression", which is "implicitly returned". 
            
            -> They are often used for "short, one-time operations" where 
                a full function definition would be unnecessarily verbose.

            -> syntax

                lambda arguments : expression

            -> Using lambda we can write one liner functions called IILE 

                Immediately Invoked Lambda Expression 

7th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Generally lambda functions will be attached with Higher Order Functions 

    -> Higher Order Functions 

        -> The goal of Higher Order Functions is to perform operations on Iterables 

        -> Concise Code, without writing lengthy code with loops 

            -> map()

                -> The map() function in Python is a built-in function that applies 
                    a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) 
                    and returns an iterator containing the results. 
                    
                    It provides a concise way to perform "transformations" on 
                        collections of data without explicitly writing loops. 

                    -> syntax

                        map(function, iterable)

                -> NOTE: Just Like Using For Loop with function


            -> filter()

                -> The filter() function in Python is a built-in function used to construct an iterator 
                from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. 
                It is a powerful tool for selectively extracting data based on a given condition.

                -> syntax

                        filter(function, iterable)

                -> NOTE: Just Like Using For Loop with condition on functions

            -> reduce()

                -> The reduce() function in Python, found within the "functools" module, is a higher-order function 
                that applies a given function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, 
                reducing the iterable to a single, cumulative value.

                -> from functools import reduce

                -> syntax

                        reduce(function, iterable)

        -> A package contains a special file named as __init__.py 

            -> __init__.py, it can be blank, but generally we keep start up initial data or
                start up configurations 
            
            -> In order to use package, use name of the folder

                Statements 
            
            -> NOTE: Here we need to explicitly close the files after operations are performed


        -> syntax 2 (recommended)

            with open("file_path","mode") as alias_name:
                Statements 
            
            with open("file.txt","r") file_data:

    -> Folders Management With Python

        -> "os" module 
        -> "shutil" module 
    
    -> Create Folders and Delete Folders 

    -> Working with "csv" file 

        -> Very commonly used with Data Oriented Applications 

    -> We have "csv" modules to handle csv file 

    -> For fixed data sets we can use reader functionality from csv module 

    -> For changing data sets we can use DictReader functionality from csv module 

13th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Writing Data To CSV Files 

        -> reader
        -> writer 
        -> DictReader
        -> DictWriter 

    -> Working with JSON Files (Dictionary Like Data)

    -> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a human-readable, text-based format 
    for "storing" and "exchanging" data that is widely used for 
    web applications, APIs, and configuration files. 

    -> JSON represents data as key-value pairs within objects 
        (enclosed in curly braces {}) -> same as Dictionary in python 

    -> Very Commonly Used in Application Development (API's)

    -> We have "json" module built in python standard library 

    -> json operations

        -> dump -> as a file we can store data accepts data and filename

        -> load -> from a json file we can read data 

        -> dumps -> object based writing 

        -> loads -> object based reading


14th Nov 2025
=============

    -> JSON File Operations Continued

    -> Working with CRUD Application Using Persistent Storage i.e files 


18th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Exception Handling 

        -> Exception : It's an "Error", which might occur during the program execution 

        -> By default when python encounters an Error, it abruptly "STOPS" the program execution

        -> To change the above default behavior, and handle the Exceptions 
            by yourself, we need following

            -> try : used to keep the code, that will cause error 

            -> except : used to keep the code that should run, when error occurs 

                -> NOTE: Try statement must have at least one except or finally clause

            -> else : used to keep the code that should run, if no Exceptions were raised in try block

            -> finally : used to keep the code that should run wether an Exception raised or not 
                       : DB / File Streams -> closing connections will be in finally block


19th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Earlier we worked with In built Exceptions provided as part of 
        python standard library (ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, ValueError etc)

        -> https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html 

        -> print(help(Exception))

    -> But sometimes you need your "own custom error" that describes a situation 
        specific to your program
    
    -> You create a custom exception by "defining a class" that inherits 
        from Python’s built-in "Exception" class. 
        This concept is connected to inheritance.

        -> syntax

            class MyCustomError(Exception):
                pass 


    -> OOP - Object Oriented Programming

        -> OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, is a programming model 
        that organizes code around "objects" which are software entities 
        that contain both data (attributes) and the methods(functions) 
        that operate on that data. 

        -> Instead of a sequence of functions, OOP focuses on objects interacting 
            with one another, making code more modular, reusable and easier to maintain.

        -> Earlier 

            -> Writing Long List Of Instruction (task oriented)

        -> Moving Forward 

            -> Thinking in terms of real world entities (objects)

                -> Object - Data (attributes/variables)

                -> Object - Behavior (methods/functions)
        
            -> Writing code that follows Object Oriented Design 

                -> Focus is on objects and their relationships, not just functions 

                -> We don't think about steps, we think about "who does what"

        -> Four Pillars Of OOP 

            -> Inheritance 

                -> Using Inheritance We Get "Reusability"

            -> Encapsulation 

                -> Binding Data & Behavior Together 

            -> Abstraction

                -> Hiding Complexity, and show only what user needs 

            -> Polymorphism

                -> Extensibility, One Entity has multiple forms 

    Compare Functional vs OOP 

    ->                      Functional Style                        Object Oriented Style 

    -> Focus                Step by step functions                  Real World Objects 

    -> Data & Function      Separate                                Combined inside a class 

    -> Code Organization    One Big Script                          Multiple Reuseable Classes 

    -> Reusability          Harder                                  Easy as for Inheritance

    -> Maintenance          Complex as code grows                   More Cleaner 


    -> Functional Style Code 

        def student_attended_session(name):
            print(f"{name} Attended Session")

    -> Object Oriented Style Code 

        class Student:

            def __init__(self, name):
                self.name = name 

            def attended_session(self):
                print(f"{self.name} Attended Session")

    -> Instance Members 

    -> Class Members 

    -> OOP Principals


20th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Object 

        -> In terms of real world, everything is an object 

        -> An object has "two" entities 

            -> An Object "has" something like Characteristics / Properties (DATA) 
                Variables (Attributes) - CAR 

                -> CAR has a brand 
                -> CAR has a price  
                -> CAR has a color etc 

            -> An Object "does" something like Behaviors (FUNCTIONS) 
                METHODS - CAR 

                -> CAR does drive forward
                -> CAR does drive backward
                -> CAR does sound horn etc 

        -> How To Create Object ?

            -> We need Class 


    -> Class 

        -> A class is a "blueprint" for creating objects 

        -> A class will define what Characteristics and Behaviors, an object should posses

        -> NOTE: Here Car class can define what can a car have and what a car can do 
    
    -> Object 

        -> An object is an real instance of a class 

    -> Class & Object Syntax 

        class ClassName:
            statements 

        object = ClassName()

    -> NOTE: In Python Classes are automatically called, unlike functions 

            -> Class call is not required 

    
    -> Methods 

        -> Methods are like functions, which are associated with objects 

        -> A Method is block of Code, which performs a task (associated with objects)

        -> Methods will be inside Class 

        ->                            Functions                              Methods

        How To Call                   function_name(args)                    object.method_name(args)

        Belongs To                    independent / global                   Object 

        Defined Using                 def function_name                      def method_name(inside class)

    
    -> When working with OOP Style, one of the Confusion initially is 

        -> Python Automatically Passes an object(self) to method 

        -> self is nothing but object reference 

        -> "self" is recommended by python, but you can pass anything as reference 

    
    -> __init__ 

        -> __init__() is a special method (also called as Constructor) 

        -> Constructors are used to initialize the data 

        -> When we create an object, Constructors are Automatically called 

        -> The __init__ method is defined within a class and always takes 
            self as its first parameter, which refers to the 
            instance of the object being created. 
        
            -> It can also take other parameters to receive values 
                for initializing the object's attributes.
            
            -> syntax 

                class MyClass:
                    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):
                        self.attribute1 = attribute1
                        self.attribute2 = attribute2
